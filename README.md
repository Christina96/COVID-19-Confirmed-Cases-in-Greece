# COVID-19-Confirmed-Cases-in-Greece
The code provides a comprehensive visualization of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Greece. It combines an interactive line chart for temporal analysis and a geographical map for spatial understanding, providing a holistic view of the data for Greece.

# Line Chart (Plotly):

The code generates a line chart using Plotly, visualizing the COVID-19 confirmed cases in Greece over time.
The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases.
Each point on the line chart corresponds to a specific date, showing the progression of confirmed cases over time.
Geographical Map (Folium):

The code creates a geographical map using Folium, centered on Greece.
A marker is placed on the map at the coordinates for Greece (latitude 39.0742, longitude 21.8243).
Summary of Interpretation:

# Line Chart:

The line chart provides insights into the trend of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Greece.
Patterns such as spikes or plateaus in the curve can indicate periods of rapid spread or stability in reported cases.
Steeper slopes may suggest an acceleration in the rate of infections.
Geographical Map:

The geographical map with a marker at the coordinates for Greece is a simple visualization to identify the location.
While not highly informative in this case, it's a basic demonstration of how you can use Folium for geographical visualizations.
 # Overall:

The combination of the line chart and map gives a quick overview of the COVID-19 situation in Greece.
Users can interact with the line chart (zoom, pan) in the Jupyter Notebook, examining specific data points.
Remember that these visualizations are based on the provided code, which uses historical COVID-19 data for Greece. The insights you gain will depend on the actual data and the timeline covered in the dataset.
